# Problem 2 - Multiples of 3 and 5

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `problem_2` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:problem_2, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `problem_2` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:problem_2]]
    end
    ```
